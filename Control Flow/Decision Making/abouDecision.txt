/* Control flow ---> Compiler will execute the code from top to bottom. In Java the statements in the code are executed according to the order in which they apper.
Java provides the statements that can control the flow.
In java provides three types of control flow....
1) Decision Making:
	i) If statement.
	ii)switch statement.
2)Loop statements
	a)do while loop
	b)while loop
	c)for loop
	d)for-each loop
3)Jump statemants
	*)break statements	
	*)continue statements

1) Decison Making:----- It decides  which statement  to execute and when.It evaluates boolean expression...
	1)If statement :-- Used to evaluate the condition.
		a)simple if --> Simple statement to be executed.
			syntax : if(condition){
					satements;
				 }
		b) if-else if --> if condition is true it will enter the code and execute the statements if not else is executed.
			syntax : if(condition)
					{
						statement1;
					}
				else
					{
						statements2;
					}
		c)if else if ladder --> it follows the if chain.

				syntax : if(condition)
						{ statement1; }
					else if(condition)
						{ statment2;}
					else
					{ statement;}

		4)Nested if --> If within the if.
				syntax : if(condition)
						{ statements;
					if (condition)
						{statement;}
					else
					    	{statement;} }

	2) switch statement:---> It is similar to the if else statements. The switch statements contains multiple block of code called
				as cases(No duplicate cases are allowed) and a single case is executed when the condition is satisfyies.
				syntax : switch(condition)
						{
						case 1: statment;
						break;
						case 2: statement;
						break;
						""
						""
						case n: statement;
						break;
						default:
							default statement;
						}
