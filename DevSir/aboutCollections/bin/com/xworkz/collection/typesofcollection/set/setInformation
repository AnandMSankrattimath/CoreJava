set working internally:
set is to store unique data.
Hash set working:
it does not allow the duplicate data?(in memory side)
-->when hashSet() is called it will by default it calls the HashMap().
in HashMap()--data is stored in the association of key.
i.e key --- value.
return type is object
put() return type is object.

HashMap.put(key,value);-- to add into map we use put().
key is our data   value is whether the data is PRESENT or not.
