Collection is also called as Java Collection API
API - collection of interfaces,methods,classes --concept abstraction.
Application Programming Interface - backbone is abstraction.

Array has 0 methods
Array has only one property called "length"

disadvantages: 
1)fixed size
2)doesnot have the inbuilt method(0 methods)
3)stored in the linear pattern it is difficult to manage the data.

To overcome these common problems we use Collections.

collection -- not stored the primitve data type...

collection has the same work done by the array but collection stored only object type data.
If we want to stores the primitive type of data as we did in array we have to use the wrapper class.
collection is the purely object oriented.
Collection is a framework in JAVA and it is an Interface to manage the data in a better way as compare to array.
FrameWork:-ReadyMade utility. 

collection has the 11 methods.Use whenever we need.No restrictions.
