Inheritance --> Accessing the data from one class to another class. note --> must be Same class/object..
child class inheritce the properties from base/ parent class.

syntax :--> child class extends parent class. 

In the execution time JVM calls the parent class constructor first and then child class..(Implicitly)

By explicitly developer also call the parent class constructor using "super();".

super() --> 1) used to call the parent class constructor.
	    2) only one super and it must be first executable statement...note : can't call multiple super statements.

JAVA doesn't supports multiple inheritance...
