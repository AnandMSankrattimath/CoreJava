1) Creating constants in java--
There are two ways :-
i) by using final keyword we can create the constants
ii) by using Enum class.

2)In java there are 2 types of datatypes present 
i) Primitive Datatypes
ii)Non-primitive datatypes.

3)To know or tell the java to the kind of data (type of value), we use datatypes.

4)Naming conventions are:
i) Pascal -- for Classes
ii)camelCase -- for methods,variables etc

5)Varibale initialization is the process to initialize the value into the varibale.

6)Array -- It is an collection of similar type of data.

7)No, can't pass the negative size in array.

8)In heap memory.

9)Advantages of Array: 
i) Array is used to store the similar type of data.
ii)Array stores the data in continuous memry location.
iii) Array has a property called length. By using this property we can find ths size of data & which is also helps to print the arra data.

10)Anonymous array  is a way of declaring the array without array name.
ex:  void get(int [10]){
	System.out.println("Anonymous array");
}

11)WAP to print the array elements.
class PrintArray{
public static void main(String [] args){
int [] elements = new int[2];
elements[0]=11;
elements[1]=22;
for(int i=0;i<elements.length;i++){
System.out.println(elements[i]);
}
}
}
12) WAP sor the array
public class SortAsc {    
    public static void main(String[] args) {        
            
        //Initialize array     
        int [] arr = new int [] {5, 2, 8, 7, 1};     
        int temp = 0;    
            
        //Displaying elements of original array    
        System.out.println("Elements of original array: ");    
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {     
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");    
        }    
            
        //Sort the array in ascending order    
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {     
            for (int j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++) {     
               if(arr[i] > arr[j]) {    
                   temp = arr[i];    
                   arr[i] = arr[j];    
                   arr[j] = temp;    
               }     
            }     
        }    
          
        System.out.println();    
            
        //Displaying elements of array after sorting    
        System.out.println("Elements of array sorted in ascending order: ");    
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {     
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");    
        }    
    }    
}    

13)Wap to two given array are same or not.
public class CheckArraysEqual {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        
        int a[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
  
        
        int b[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
  
        
        
        boolean result = Arrays.equals(a, b);//using equals method to comapre two array.
        if (result == true) {
          
            System.out.println("Two arrays are equal");
        }
        else {
          
            System.out.println("Two arrays are not equal");
        }
    }
}


14)WAP throw ArrayOutOfBoundsException.
class ArrayException{
public static void main(String [] args){
try{
int [] elements = new int[2];
elements[0]=11;
elements[1]=22;
System.out.println(elements[2]);
}catch(Exception e){
	e.printStackTrace();
}
}

15) Before intialization of an array we must declare an array with the size(reserved memory).
 If we do not initialize the array the reserved memory is going to waste.
 
16)WAP largest & smallest number in given array.



17) static keyword - It is keyword which has the special meaning.
	static variable - These are the variables which are declared with the help of static keyword.These varibales are also called as the class variables.
	static method - writing the method signature with the help of static keyword it is called static method.
	So, these static varibales and methods can able access without creating the object of that class.
	
18)Yes,We can overload and override the static methods in Java.

19) why main() is static?
--In java the program execution is starts with main(). static is helps to execute the program without creating the objects.
Hence, main() method always execute first beacuse of static keyword.

20)Static block is set of instruction which executes when the class is loaded into memory.

21) Can Interface has static methods?
It is depends on the java version.
But I have used only the abstract methods till now.

22) Constructor chaining - calling one cnstructor into the another constructor.

23)constructor is a special type of method which is used to initialize the values.
It has same name as the classname and which returns nothing even void.

24) constructor cannot be a static because constrctor called when the object is created. but static is called when the class is loaded into the memory.


25) If you keep return for constructor it will throw an error called stackOverflow.

26)In inheritance child class can access the properties from its parent class but reverse of it we can go for the downcasting.

27) syntax : ParentClass reference = new ChildClass();

28) class is in compile time. instance/object in run time.
class does not have the memory until the object is created.

29)In 5 ways we can create the instance as of now I only known about using new keyword.

30)If you create the instance of class the class members will get the memory.
